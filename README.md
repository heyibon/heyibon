# Project Covidentity
## Introduction
There are 500 million people infected with Covid-19 worldwide, and the current testing devices have several drawbacks, such as the inaccuracy of temperature measurement results and high cost of disposable quick screening kits.  Therefore, we hope to build a new detection method by packing ARC, sensors, and raspberry pi together.  With high accuracy and shorter predicting time, it collects ECG signals from fingers of both hands and uses neural network for analysis and prediction.  Finally, it can present the identity information of the subject and whether he or she has COVID-19 in the meantime on cloud.  We hope that this product can be used in various places and entrances to play a role in preventing the spread of the epidemic, while the reusable feature on our product can also reduce the cost of medical resources.
